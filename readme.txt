Back up your old settings first. 
Below is a slightly modified list of 50 some rebindable key functions.
Bindings for controllers are left alone.
You can bind extra mouse buttons with "Mouse4" and up.
You cannot bind quicksave as far as I know. I've already looked into it.
You cannot bind symbols (!,%;] etc)
Warning, still in development. I haven't played through the whole game yet.

Now supports some game pad rebinding. The situation where some bindings are press and hold while others are just a press might cause some issues. I haven't tested this much. If you had to press and hold before you still have to press and hold the new button.

Might need to mark the downloaded file "read-only" so the game doesn't revert your changes.
