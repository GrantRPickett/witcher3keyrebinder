<body><h3> The unoffical Witcher 3 keyboard rebinder</h3>


	<div>Back up your old settings first. 
		<br>Below is a slightly modified list of 50 some rebindable key functions.<br> Bindings for controllers are left alone.<br> You can bind extra mouse buttons with "Mouse4" and up.<br>
		You cannot bind quicksave as far as I know. I've already looked into it.<br> You cannot bind symbols (!,%;] etc)<br> Warning, still in development. I haven't played through the whole game yet.<br>This website is not officially endorsed or associated with CDPR or the Witcher video games.

		<br>
		Now supports some game pad rebinding. The situation where some bindings are press and hold while others are just a press might cause some issues. I haven't tested this much. If you had to press and hold before, you likely still have to press and hold the new button. Same reason I can't get around "double tap to gallop" right now on pc.<br>


		<b>You need to mark the downloaded file "read-only" so the game doesn't revert your changes!</b><br>
